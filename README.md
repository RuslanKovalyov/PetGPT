# PetGPT

## Overview
PetGPT is a project created by Ruslan Kovalev, inspired by the teachings and code of Andrej Karpathy. This project is an attempt to learn and apply concepts in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly focusing on language models.

## Inspiration
The project was inspired by the code and YouTube lessons by Andrej Karpathy. You can find his insightful tutorial here: [Andrej Karpathy's YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY). This project is a result of my learning journey, where I have attempted to recreate and adapt concepts from the original work in my own style and understanding.

## Objective
The primary objective of PetGPT is to provide a learning experience in building and understanding language models. It is also a platform for me to experiment with different aspects of AI in a hands-on manner.

## Disclaimer
PetGPT is a personal project and a learning exercise. The code quality and practices may differ from professional standards as it is part of my learning process. I encourage feedback and contributions to improve this project.
