# PetGPT

## Overview
PetGPT, created by Ruslan Kovalev, is an exploratory project in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a focus on language models. This project is inspired by and builds upon the teachings and code of Andrej Karpathy, aiming to apply these concepts in a practical setting.

## Inspiration
This project draws inspiration from Andrej Karpathy's code and YouTube tutorials, particularly [this informative lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY). PetGPT represents my journey in learning and adapting these concepts, molded in my own style and understanding.

## Objective
The goal of PetGPT is to facilitate a hands-on learning experience in the development and comprehension of language models. It serves as a personal platform for experimentation and exploration within various facets of AI.

## Disclaimer
As a personal and educational project, PetGPT is a reflection of my ongoing learning process. The code quality and practices may not align with professional standards. I welcome constructive feedback and contributions to further enhance this project.
